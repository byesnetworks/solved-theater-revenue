A movie theater only keeps a percentage of the revenue earned from ticket sales. The remainder goes to the movie company. Create a GUI application that allows the user to enter the following data into text fields:

# Price per adult ticket

# Number of adult tickets sold

# Price per child ticket

# Number of child tickets sold

The application should calculate and display the following data for one nightâ€™s box office business at a theater:

<ul>

 <li> Gross revenue for adult tickets sold: This is the amount of money taken in for all adult tickets sold.</li>

 <li> Net revenue for adult tickets sold: This is the amount of money from adult ticket sales left over after the payment to the movie company has been deducted.</li>

 <li> Gross revenue for child tickets sold: This is the amount of money taken in for all child tickets sold.</li>

 <li> Net revenue for child tickets sold: This is the amount of money from child ticket sales left over after the payment to the movie company has been deducted.</li>

 <li> Total gross revenue: This is the sum of gross revenue for adult and child tickets sold.</li>

 <li> Total net revenue: This is the sum of net revenue for adult and child tickets sold.</li>

</ul>

Assume the theater keeps 20 percent of its box office receipts. Use a constant in your code to represent this percentage.
